# Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree - Course 3
## Project: Data Warehouse in Amazon Redshift

### Introduction
<p>A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.</p>

<p>In this project, we are building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team to find insights into what songs their users are listening to </p>

### Datasets

<p>
There are two datasets that reside in S3.
  
#### Song Dataset
  
Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
  
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

**Sample**
  
> {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}


#### Log Dataset
  
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
  
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

### Table Schema
  
#### Fact Table
**songplays** - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
> songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
  
#### Dimension Tables
  
**users** - users in the app
> user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
  
**songs** - songs in music database
> song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
  
**artists** - artists in music database
> artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
> start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
  
### Implementation
  
#### create_tables.py 
Includes the script to connect to the database and create the staging tables and analytical tables

#### dwh.cfg
Includes all the configuration details to connect to the redshift database
  
#### sql_queries.py
Includes all the queries required in the projects like DROP,CREATE,COPY,INSERT Queries which are imported in the etl.py file later to process.
  
#### etl.py
This includes the logic to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.

### Steps To Run
  <ol>
    <li> Launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3</li>
    <li> Add redshift database and IAM role informations and other required details to **dwh.cfg**.</li>
    <li> Run **create_tables.py** This will create tables. Verify the table schemas in the redshift database.</li>
    <li> Run **etl.py** to load the data on to respective tables </li>
    <li> Verify the results with proper queries</li>
  </ol>
  
#### Result
The count of rows in each table after the load were tested with respective queries. Got the results as below.
